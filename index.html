                    Photographic Archives</h1>
                <p>Bobbie Hanvey is an award winning photographer living and working in Northern Ireland. The John J.
                    Burns Library acquired the first part of the Bobbie Hanvey Photographic Archives in 2001, with major
                    additions to the collection made in 2008 and 2009, bringing the total number of negatives in the
                    Hanvey Archives to more than 50,000. </p>
                <p>Hanvey's photographs comprise a comprehensive documentation of people and life in the North of
                    Ireland beginning in the 1970’s through circa 2007. Some photographs feature subjects photographed
                    in various other locations in Ireland. The collection contains portraits, candid images (including
                    weddings and other social events) as well as journalistic images covering public, paramilitary and
                    political activity. </p>
                <p>Boston College Libraries, in order to create access for scholars and any interested parties, has
                    initiated a project to digitize, describe, and host the photographs.</p>
                <p><strong>The collection is arranged in 13 series. Descriptions and links to each series in the
                    Libraries' online digital repository are found under <a href="series.html">Series Listing</a>.
